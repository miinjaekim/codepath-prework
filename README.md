## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

3-5 favorite applications and 2-3 features that make them my favorite app:

- **BeReal**
    - Posting pictures that snap images from the back and front cameras.
    - Only being allowed to view posts of others once a user posts their own picture first.

- **Habitica**
    - Syncing across devices.
    - Adding tags to different tasks created.

- **App idea I would like to build:**
    - A goals, vision, and reflections sharing app. Friends can use this app to set their intentions for the day, week, month, year, etc. Progress and reflections are shared with others that are also sharing their authentic progress. The goal is that friends can be there for each other on the journey providing support and accountability. 
    - For features:
        - a way to set and share goals, visions, or intentions for various timespans.
        - users that have shared their own visions are the only ones that can see the intentions of others as well.
        - a way to reflect on how the goal was achieved or was a challenge once the pre-set timespan for a goal, vision, or intention has passed.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- Figuring out how to add buttons and labels onto the view controller took some effort at first. A quick google search helped me figure out that I needed to press and hold on a label or button to add it.
